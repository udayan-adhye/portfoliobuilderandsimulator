    content: `An investment analysis tool for Indian markets that lets you simulate and compare investment portfolios using historical data.

**Features:**
- Lumpsum investment simulation
- SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) simulation
- Historical NAV comparison

**Use it to:**
- Backtest investment portfolios
- Compare assets (mutual funds, indices, etc.)
- Understand rolling returns and volatility`,
  },

  'portfolios-assets': {
    title: 'Portfolios & Assets',
    content: `**Asset:**
A single investable asset — a mutual fund, an index, a stock, etc.

**Portfolio:**
A combination of one or more assets with allocation percentages.

**Examples:**
- Single-asset portfolio: 100% NIFTY 50
- Multi-asset portfolio: 70% Equity Fund + 30% Debt Fund

**Why portfolios?**
You can compare different approaches side by side:
- Portfolio 1: Pure equity (100% NIFTY 50)
- Portfolio 2: Balanced (70% equity + 30% debt)
- Portfolio 3: Diversified (60% equity + 30% debt + 10% gold)

Each portfolio appears as a separate line on the chart.

**Important:** Allocations within a portfolio must add up to exactly 100%. The app shows a warning if they don't.`,
  },

  'xirr-explained': {
    title: 'What is XIRR?',
    content: `XIRR (Extended Internal Rate of Return) is the annualized return that accounts for irregular cash flows.

**Why XIRR over CAGR?**
- CAGR works for lumpsum (single investment, single redemption)
- XIRR handles multiple investments at different times (like SIP)

**Example:**
If you invested ₹10,000/month for 5 years and your corpus is ₹8,50,000, XIRR tells you the effective annual return considering each monthly investment date.`,
  },

  'why-rolling': {
    title: 'Why Rolling Returns?',
    content: `Most websites show only a few return values: 1Y, 3Y, 5Y returns from today.

**The problem:**
These are just single data points. An asset showing 15% 5Y return today might have shown 8% last year and 22% the year before. You're seeing a snapshot, not the full picture.

**Rolling returns show everything:**
Instead of one 5-year return, you see ALL possible 5-year returns the asset has generated. Every point on the chart is a return for a different start date.

**What you can learn:**
- **Consistency:** Is the asset reliably good, or just lucky timing?
- **Range:** What's the best and worst case?
- **Probability:** How often did the asset beat X%?

**Example:**
An asset's 5Y return today is 12%. But rolling returns show it ranged from 6% to 18% over the last decade. Now you know what to realistically expect.`,

  // Lumpsum Simulator
  'lumpsum-simulator': {
    title: 'Lumpsum Simulator',
    content: `Simulates a one-time investment over historical periods.

**How to use:**
1. Add portfolios (each can have multiple assets with allocations)
2. Select assets (mutual funds, indices, etc.)
3. Set investment amount and period (years)
4. Click "Plot" to see results

**Reading the chart (example: 3-year, point on 10-Jan-2023):**
You invested ₹x once on 10-Jan-2020.
- **XIRR View:** Point = annualized return (CAGR) for this period
- **Corpus View:** Point = final portfolio value in ₹

Shows all possible returns/values for any 3-year lumpsum in this portfolio.

**Multi-asset portfolios:**
Allocate across multiple assets (e.g., 70% equity, 30% debt) to see combined performance.

**Transaction Details:**
Click any point on the chart to see the complete transaction history — every buy with date, NAV, units, and amount.`,
  },

  // SIP Simulator
  'sip-simulator': {
    title: 'SIP Simulator',
    content: `Simulates monthly SIP investments over historical periods.

**How to use:**
1. Add portfolios with asset allocations
2. Enable step-up or rebalancing if needed
3. Select period and click "Plot"

**Reading the chart (example: 3-year, point on 10-Jan-2023):**
You invested ₹x monthly from 10-Jan-2020 to 10-Dec-2022 (36 investments).
- **XIRR View:** Point = XIRR return of this SIP
- **Corpus View:** Point = final portfolio value in ₹

Shows all possible returns/values for any 3-year SIP in this portfolio.

**Multi-asset SIP:**
Your monthly amount is split across assets based on allocation percentages.

**Transaction Details:**
Click any point on the chart to see complete transaction history — all monthly investments, rebalances (if enabled), with dates, NAV, units, and amounts.`,

  'sip-stepup': {
    title: 'Step-up SIP',
    content: `Increases your monthly SIP amount by a fixed percentage every year.

**Example (10% step-up, SIP started 15-Mar-2020):**
- Mar 2020 to Feb 2021: ₹10,000/month
- Mar 2021 to Feb 2022: ₹11,000/month (increased on 15-Mar-2021)
- Mar 2022 to Feb 2023: ₹12,100/month (increased on 15-Mar-2022)

Step-up kicks in on each year anniversary of your SIP start date.

**Why use it?**
- Matches income growth
- Accelerates wealth building
- Combats inflation`,
  },

  'sip-rebalancing': {
    title: 'Rebalancing',
    content: `Rebalancing restores your portfolio to target allocations when they drift beyond a threshold.

**When does it happen?**
Checked on each SIP date (monthly), after your regular SIP investment is made.

**Order of operations on each SIP date:**
1. Regular SIP buy happens first (split by allocation %)
2. Portfolio is checked for drift
3. If any asset drifts beyond threshold → rebalance triggers

**Example (70:30 target, 5% threshold):**
- After SIP, equity is at 76%, debt at 24%
- Drift = 6% (exceeds 5% threshold)
- System sells equity, buys debt to restore 70:30

**Note:**
Only relevant for multi-asset portfolios. Disabled for single-asset portfolios.`,
  },

  // Historical Values
  'historical-values': {
    title: 'Historical Values',
    content: `View and compare historical NAV of assets on a single chart.

**Use it to:**
- Check raw NAV values of any asset
- Find when an asset started (first available date)
- Compare growth of multiple assets over time

**How to use:**
1. Add assets you want to view/compare
2. Select asset type and specific asset
3. Click "Plot"

**Logarithmic Scale:**
Enable log scale when comparing assets with different absolute values.

Example:
- Asset A: ₹10 → ₹100 (10x growth, 900% return)
- Asset B: ₹1000 → ₹2000 (2x growth, 100% return)

On a linear chart, B looks like it grew more (₹1000 increase vs ₹90).
On a log chart, A correctly appears as the bigger winner.

Use log scale to compare actual performance, not just absolute values.`,

**Rolling Returns Chart:**
Shows returns for every possible investment window. Each point = return if you ended on that date.

**Distribution Histogram:**
Groups rolling returns into 20 buckets. Shows what % of returns fell in each range (per portfolio).

**Volatility Chart:**
Shows annualized volatility (%) for each rolling period — how risky the investment was.`,

  'rolling-xirr': {
    title: 'Rolling Returns Chart',
    content: `Shows returns for every possible investment window of the selected duration.

**What each point means:**
"If my investment ended on this date after X years, what would my return be?"

**What to look for:**
- **Consistency:** Flat line = stable returns across time
- **Range:** Gap between best and worst = risk indicator
- **Trends:** Upward/downward patterns over market cycles

Helps answer: "What's the probability of achieving X% returns?"`,
  },

  'histogram': {
    title: 'Distribution Histogram',
    content: `Groups all rolling returns into 20 buckets and shows what percentage fell in each range.

**How to read it:**
- X-axis: Return ranges (buckets are auto-calculated based on min/max)
- Y-axis: Percentage of returns in that range
- For each portfolio, its bars add up to 100%
- Taller bar = more common outcome for that portfolio

**What to look for:**
- **Peak location:** Where most returns cluster (expected outcome)
- **Spread:** Wide = unpredictable, narrow = consistent
- **Left tail:** What % of returns were negative/low

**Example:**
If Portfolio A's 10-12% bar shows 25%, it means 25% of all historical returns for Portfolio A fell in 10-12%.

**Note:** The distribution is only meaningful if you have enough data points. If the date range is short, you'll have fewer rolling periods, making the distribution less reliable. For example, a 5-year rolling analysis on 6 years of data gives very few data points.`,
  },

  'drawdown': {
    title: 'Max Drawdown Chart',
    content: `Shows the maximum peak-to-trough decline during each rolling period — a measure of downside risk.

**How it's calculated:**
1. Track the running peak (highest portfolio value seen so far)
2. At each point, measure how far the current value has fallen from the peak
3. The worst (deepest) such fall during the period is the max drawdown

**What each point means:**
"If my investment ended on this date, what was the worst decline I would have experienced during this period?"

**Reading the chart:**
- Values are always 0% or negative
- -10% means the portfolio fell 10% from its peak before recovering
- -30% means a severe 30% decline occurred
- Closer to 0% = less downside risk

**Example:**
You invested ₹1,00,000. At some point it grew to ₹1,50,000 (peak), then fell to ₹1,05,000 before recovering. Max drawdown = (1,05,000 - 1,50,000) / 1,50,000 = -30%.

**Use it to:**
- Understand the worst-case scenario you'd have faced
- Compare which portfolio had a smoother ride
- Decide if you can stomach the potential declines`,
  },

  'volatility': {
    title: 'Volatility Chart',
    content: `Shows annualized volatility (%) for each rolling period — a measure of risk.

**How it's calculated:**
1. Take daily portfolio values during the investment period
2. Calculate daily returns (% change each day)
3. On SIP days, cash flow is excluded so only market movement counts
4. Weekends/holidays are skipped (no artificial zero returns)
5. Standard deviation of daily returns × √(~252 trading days/year) = annualized volatility

**What each point means:**
"If my investment ended on this date, how volatile was the ride?"

**Reading the chart:**
- Higher % = more volatile = riskier
- Lower % = steadier = less risky
- Compare portfolios to see which had a smoother ride

**Use it to:**
- Understand the risk you'd have experienced
- Compare risk profiles of different portfolios
- See if volatility changed over market cycles`,
